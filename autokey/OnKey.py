# Why this script?
# "ยง", which opens "Select other" is shift+alt_gr+s in Ubuntu sv_dvorak.
# This results in Onshape thinking that only "s" is pressed.
# (I think the reason that I have to actually send "`" is because that is the key
# for the Javascript keycode on US keyboards.

# AutoKey API reference: https://autokey.github.io/

# How to replace a key:
# Check correct keycode with QWERTY keyboard in browser console
# document.body.onkeydown = e => console.log(e);
# --> keyCode: 192
# (This is NOT the same as the input/kernel keycode used in xmodmap)
# Google for javascript keycode 192 (grave accent)
# Map unused keyboard keycode (97 - presumably F13 place?) with xmodmap to the found key
# xmodmap -pke   to find unused key and also figure out the X name for the key to use
# xmodmap -e 'keycode 97 = grave'
# Send the keycode using <codeXX>

# Note: Keys without modifiers in the target keyboard layout should be possible
#       to send directly. E.g. send_keys('a')

# TODO: Actually support sending different keys by listening in code

# X keycode: X keysym
key_map = { 97: 'grave' }
