Utilities for Onshape

## OnKey

AutoKey script for Linux to replace a key sent to Onshape. For
example, to fix "Select Other" when using a non-default keyboard
layout.

Assign a hotkey (the key you want to fix, e.g. `'`) and set the window
filter to only match Onshape tabs (e.g. `.*\|.* - Mozilla Firefox`)
for the Onkey script. Modify the script to change which key gets sent
to Onshape.
